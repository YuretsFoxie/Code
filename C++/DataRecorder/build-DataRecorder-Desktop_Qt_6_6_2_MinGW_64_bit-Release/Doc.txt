Sampling frequency: 100 Hz for the test signal, 512 Hz for the real data (4 channels are used, it would be 2048 for 1 channel)

TODO:
Optimize displaying the graph, now it freezes, consider displaying the average values instead of each of them, moving functionality to background threads, etc.
Update the spectrum to show the new data, make the visualization clear.

Adjust the displayed data.
Play with the application to see what should be done next.
