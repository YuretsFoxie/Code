The software initial stage is ready.
Connection parameters: COM3 57600
Sampling frequency: 128 Hz (it will be 64 Hz when two values are measured)



TODO:
Research the FFT results interpretation.
Test the spectrum analyzer with the test data provider.
Implement displaying the FFT results at the graph.

LATER: 
Optimise the FFT by caching the results if needed.

FFT results imterpretation (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6740545/understanding-fft-output): 
1. You should neither look for the real or imaginative part of a complex number 
(that what's your real and imaginary array is). Instead you want to look for the magnitude 
of the frequency which is defined as sqrt (real * real + imag * imag). This number will 
always be positive. Now all you have to search is for the maximum value (ignore the first 
entry in your array. That is your DC offset and carries no frequency dependent information).

2. You get 32 real and 32 imaginary outputs because you are using a complex to complex FFT.
Remember that you've converted your 32 samples into 64 values (or 32 complex values) by 
extending it with zero imaginary parts. This results in a symetric FFT output where the 
frequency result occurs twice. Once ready to use in the outputs 0 to N/2, and once mirrored 
in the outputs N/2 to N. In your case it's easiest to simply ignore the outputs N/2 to N. 
You don't need them, they are just an artifact on how you calculate your FFT.

3. The frequency to fft-bin equation is (bin_id * freq/2) / (N/2) where freq is your 
sample-frequency (aka 32 Hz, and N is the size of your FFT). In your case this simplifies 
to 1 Hz per bin. The bins N/2 to N represent negative frequencies (strange concept, I know). 
For your case they don't contain any significant information because they are just a mirror 
of the first N/2 frequencies.

4. Your real and imaginary parts of each bin form a complex number. It is okay if real and 
imaginary parts are negative while the magnitude of the frequency itself is positive (see my 
answer to question 1). I suggest that you read up on complex numbers. Explaining how they work 
(and why they are useful) exceeds what is possible to explain in a single stackoverflow-question.

Note: You may also want to read up what autocorrelation is, and how it is used to find the 
fundamental frequency of a signal. I have a feeling that this is what you really want.
