FIX reading the ADC data. Implement one channel data displaying first.
	Make the single file test MVP, which combines UART and Graphics functionality.
	The measured FPS is about 64. It means, that renderer can't update each 1/128 of second. Possible solution: redraw for each N values (N > 1) instaed of redrawing for each new value.

COM-port: add the settings, consider adding the stop data sending check (send some code from the MCU after the stop command is accepted, instead of sending a fixed amount of zeros to it).

frequency resolution = sampling_frequency / spectrum_n
df=fs/N
